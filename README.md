# language-learning-app-frontend
Welcome to the frontend codebase for the Language Learning App. This project is designed to help users enhance their language skills through interactive exercises and contextual learning.

https://miguelklemmsilva.com

Hosted using AWS and Cloudflare for free using free tier and serverless services.

## Overview
The primary motivation behind this app was to create a platform where users can input vocabulary they wish to learn. The app then generates sentences using ChatGPT, placing the words in context. This not only helps in memorizing the vocabulary but also in understanding its usage. Additionally, the app offers exercises in translation, listening, and speaking to further hone language skills.

# Features
## User management
* AWS Cognito is used for user registration and management
* Supports Google account login for user convenience.

## Home Page
* Displays essential information such as words to practice and active exercises.

## Vocabulary Table
* Allows users to sort by any category.
* Provides the functionality to delete words.
* Features an "Add Vocabulary" option that validates words before adding them to the table.

When you press Add Vocabulary it brings up a modal window with a text box. The words are then sent to the server to check if they are valid. If they are, they're added to the vocabulary table.

## Settings
Customise language settings, choose dialects and accents, and select preferred exercises.

# Exercises
## Translation
Translate sentences from your native language to the target language. Azure translation provides mappings between source and target languages, offering helpful tooltips when hovering over words.

### Verification Techniques:
Before ChatGPT-4 was as cheap as it is now, I had to think of a cheaper way of correcting user translations:

There are many ways to translate a sentence, there usually is no one correct answer. So to verify whether a sentence is correct or not I used Hugging Face models to check sentence similarity between the user translation and original, and I used the models to verify sentence fluency (for grammar checking).
#### Sentence similarity
Using the [paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1) model sentence embeddings are generated then the cosine distance of the embeddings can be found to derive a score between 0 and 1 for sentence similarity
#### Sentence fluency
[xlm-roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base) is used to mask each token in the sentence one by one and see how probable the original token is according to the model's prediction. If the sentence is grammatically correct, the model should assign high probabilities to the original tokens.
The [Language Tool](https://languagetool.org/) API is also used for rules based checking of grammar. Roberta is useful for more subtle grammatical mistakes.

Although the sentences aren't the exact same, they mean the exact same thing so the algorithm has decided the translation is correct.

The app now uses ChatGPT so the user gets feedback on their translations.

## Listening
Practice listening with lifelike speech generated by the Azure Text to Speech API. The accent adapts based on the selected country for the language.

## Speaking
[Azure Pronunciation Assessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/pronunciation-assessment-tool?tabs=display) is used to give feedback on a user's pronunciation. The user receives 3 unique scores: Accuracy, Fluency and Completeness. The accuracy of the pronunciation is broken down further into individual words, a score for that is given for each word pronounced.
